It presents a real-time posture analysis system designed to monitor and evaluate the sitting or standing posture of an individual using pose estimation techniques. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the system identifies body keypoints from webcam input and classifies the posture as either "good" or "bad." If a user maintains a bad posture continuously for more than a predefined duration (20â€“30 seconds), the system automatically sends an alert message via Telegram, prompting the user to correct their posture. The system aims to promote better ergonomic habits and prevent long-term health issues related to poor posture. It integrates real-time feedback, user-friendly alerts, and can be deployed in home, office, or educational environments.
