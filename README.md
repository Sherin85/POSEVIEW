Pose estimation is a computer vision technique that predicts and tracks the location of a person or object. This is done by looking at a combination of the pose and the orientation of a given person/object. Pose estimation is typically done by identifying, locating, and tracking the number of key points on a given object. In the case of humans, these key points represent major joints like an elbow or knee. This Python-based Pose Estimation project has been developed to help with detecting and tracking abnormalities in the gait of elderly individuals. As the age of a human being advances their body becomes susceptible to more and more diseases. Overall, PoseView represents a significant advancement in the field of pose estimation, providing a versatile and accessible platform for analyzing human motion. and behavior through image processing techniques. The availability of PoseView as an open-source software package facilitates its adoption and further development by the research community, paving the way for future advancements in pose estimation technology.
